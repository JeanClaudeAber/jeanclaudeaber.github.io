- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a public online portfolio to express my work done in theatre, acting and voice overs through showreels, recordings and gallery.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning github pages setup using a custom sub domain name.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with javascript (FE & BE).
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: jean_aber@hotmail.com

Regards,
Jean Claude Aber
